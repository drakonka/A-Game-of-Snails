A-Game-of-Snails
================

A very rough start to a snail racing and breeding game, released in an unfinished state for One Game a Month (May). 

Important: At the moment the passwords you create here are stored as plain text in a database. To be safe, use totally unique passwords that are not associated with any of your other online accounts.

Right now all you can do in this game is breed your snails and create/enter races. Everything is a placeholder and there are countless bugs in pretty much every mechanic (with breeding possibly being the most "playable").
